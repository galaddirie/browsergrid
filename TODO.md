- [ ] Profile integration
- [ ] Add session state machine and reconilliation worker
- [x] connect to phoneix channels for streaming
- [x] use sonnar instead of phoneix flash messages
- [ ] default to chromium on arm64 systems ( mac with m1/m2/m3, linux arm64, etc )
- [ ] Edge routing ( /bg/:id should proxy to session host )

- [ ] Webhook integration
- [ ] idle browser nodes for fast acquisition
- [ ] pooled sessions
- [ ] adding CUA endpoint for browser
    - [ ] add visual ( similar to chatgpt where we should a  rendering  similar to this https://screen.studio/?aff=Yy75o )
    - [ ] chat  (jido agents?)
    - Note: our chat feature will likely need to use pooled sessions for fast acquisition and efficient use of resources
    - we wouldnt want to constinantly cycle through sessions in a chat like evironment where user requests are frequent
    - we would need to figure out how to handle the session lifecycle in a chat like environment
    - we would want to keep the user browser state active and wouldnt want to charge users for the idle time between chat messages
      - ex. message 1: user asks for a visit a website, 10 minutes later message 2: user asks to do an action this page. 
      - do we charge for the 10 minutes of idle time?
      - would we create a profile for each chat and keep that profile hot swaping it into an available node each time the user sends a message?
      - would it be possible to restore the near exact state of the browser from the previous message?
      -maybe add a flag for persistant chat browser sessions and warn users that they will be charged for the idle time between messages while the chat window is open
- [ ] test to see if we can test 1 million sessions ( fake pods/containers) 

- [ ] Deployment integration
